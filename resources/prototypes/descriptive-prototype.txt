What distinguishes us from other apps like Meetup, Eventbrite, FB Events
   - anonymity
       - any guest can join any hosted event with unfilled spots
       - allows people to be grouped by a common interest or activity
       - ensures non-excludability of guests
           - focus remains on the activity
           - avoids cherry picking of guests based on an online profile
           - facilitates genuine interaction among strangers
   - spontaneity
       - last minute events are possible and encouraged
       - dissociates any perceived formality from the event
       - want to emphasize this by the sudden popping up and disappearance of events
       - at first we can target this audience by capping the group size
   - small group size
       - again, we can expand into the larger group market
       - at first we want to encourage small groups which can be joined easily on an uneventful friday night
   - flexibility of group size
       - events can range from 2 people getting together for lunch to a blowout party
       - boosts the number of events
       - shouldn't be priority. we want to slowly ease into the larger event market
   - specificity of group size
       - a group size selected by the host is strictly enforced on the app
   - interest driven
   - accessable
   - group to group compatible

Basic UX for host
- create and post an event complete with title and description
- select a desired number of users for the event
- add a time frame to the event
- add location scope to an event (either manually chose radius or use recommended radius)
- add tags to an event to help searchability
- (option to verify guest attendance)

Basic UX for guest
- view interactive map of events
- adjust zoom of map to view more/less events
- view individual events
- enroll in an event and receive event details
- (verify attendance if requested by host)


App Structure
- native (from scratch)
OR
- hybrid (shared codebase)
   1) React Native (Javascript)
   2) NativeScript (Javascript)
   3) Flutter (Dart)
   4) Appcelerator Titanium (Javascript)
   5) Ionic (Javascript)
   6) Xamarin (C#)
   4) Web App (node.js), Android Studio (Android, 200 hours avg), Swift (iOS, 400 hours avg)

Relationships
- user -> host
- host -> user
- user -> user ?
- host -> host ?

Detailed UX for Host/Guest

General Login
- users begin on a login screen
   1) can login with their Google or Facebook account or
   2) can create an app managed account using their email and a secure password
- there is no barrier to sign up (besides having an email address)

Intermediate phase
- brief tutorial ??
- enable location services
- force the user to either select Host or Guest mode (optional information button for each mode)

Host mode
       Host mode registration
           - users must fill out additional fields to become a host such as:
               required
               - First and Last Name (or alternatively Organization name)
               - screen name for display to guests
               - Phone number ?
               - Interest tags ?
               - Personal bio ?
               optional
               - saved credit card/payment information

       Dashboard
           - hosts will see a list of events which they are currently hosting (My Future Events)
           - hosts have the option to
               1) create a new event (see Event creation)
               2) view past events and analytical data for those events (see My Event History)
               3) profile data can be viewed and edited (see Host Profile)

       Create Event
           - this page is for the creation of an event by a host
           - host must fill out a series of fields which describe their event such as:
               - title of the event
               - somewhat detailed description of the event
               - the address of the event
               - start date and time for the event
               - date and time to activate the event
               - selection of descriptive tags associated with the event (should there be a upper limit on the number of tags?)
               - number of host-invited guests
               - number of slots left to fill by guests on the app
               - maximum number of guest invites
           OR
               - search past events for ideas ?
          
           - display event preview and submit button
           - display success message
           - display list of apps on which to share the event

       My Future Events
           - list future events managed by the host (display name, date and time, active/inactive)
           - allow hosts to view a comprehensive display of the event, containing all of the fields, and allow them to edit this list of fields (up until a given amount of time before the event)
           - allow hosts to choose to cancel an event (and confirm the cancelation)

       My Past Events
           - list past events managed by the host (display name, date and time, guest rating)
           - allow hosts to view a comprehensive display of the event, containing all of the fields and analytics from the guest ratings

       Host Profile
           - allow hosts to view (first and last name, their calculated guest rating score) and modify personal fields (screen name, interest tags, personal bio)

       Event Promotion ??

       Paid event creation
           - events which require a form of payment can also be created on the app
           - host would fill out additional fields such as cost of entry for each guest and venue specific information
           - need to do more research on how to bill hosts. could be a flat rate or a percentage of each guest's ticket
  
Guest mode
       - NOTE: guests do not have additional information attached to their account to maintain anonymity 

       Dashboard
       - guests will immediately see a list of events for which they have RSVP 
       - guests will have the option to:
           1) view an interactive events map
               - events are presented graphically as pins on a map
               - events are presented in a slide or scroll list
               - search bar for finding a specific location
               - filter button - events can be filtered by:
                   - title and description keywords
                   - any number of event tags
                   - time and date of the event (spontaneity filter)
                   - size of the event
                   - number of allowed guest invites
                   - host credibility rating
           2) view a feed of events by hosts they follow (I wonder if this could be better implemented as an additional filter on the interactive events map)
           3) view a list of past events you've attended (see Past Events)
           4)


          
Todo
- paper prototype and test with users (x5)
- learn NativeScript or React Native
- build simple version of prototype
