Find people. Do stuff.

What distinguishes us from other apps like Meetup, Eventbrite, FB Events
    - anonymity 
        - any guest can join any hosted event with unfilled spots
        - allows people to be grouped by a common interest or activity
        - ensures non-excludability of guests
            - focus remains on the activity
            - avoids cherry picking of guests based on an online profile
            - facilitates genuine interaction among strangers
    - spontaneity
        - last minute events are possible and encouraged
        - dissociates any percieved formality from the event
        - want to emphesize this by the sudden popping up and dissapearance of events
        - at first we can target this audience by capping the group size
    - small group size
        - agian, we can expand into the larger group market
        - at first we want to encourage small groups which can be joined easily on an uneventful friday night
    - flexibility of group size 
        - events can range from 2 people getting together for lunch to a blowout party
        - boosts the number of events
        - shouldn't be priority. we want to slowly ease into the larger event market
    - specificity of group size
        - a group size selected by the host is strictly enforced on the app
    - interest driven
    - accessable
    - group to group compatible

UX for host
 - create and post an event complete with title and description
 - select a desired number of users for the event
 - add a time frame to the event
 - add location scope to an event (either manually chose radius or use recommended radius)
 - add tags to an event to help searchablility
 - (option to verify guest attendance)

UX for guest
 - view interactive map of events
 - adjust zoom of map to view more/less events
 - view individual events
 - enroll in an event and recieve event details
 - (verify attendance if requested by host)

        Event Promotion ??

        Paid event creation
            - events which require a form of payment can also be created on the app
            - host would fill out additional fields such as cost of entry for each guest and venue specific information
            - need to do more research on how to bill hosts. could be a flat rate or a percentage of each guest's ticket
    
    2) Guest mode
        - NOTE: guests do not have additional information attached to their account to maintain anonymity  

        Dashboard
        - guests will immediately see a list of events for which they have RSVPd  
        - guests will have the option to:
            1) view an interactive events map
                - events are presented graphically as pins on a map
                - events are presented in a slide or scroll list 
                - search bar for finding a specific location
                - filter button - events can be filtered by:

                    - host credibility rating
            2) view a feed of events by hosts they follow (I wonder if this could be better implemented as an additional filter on the interactive events map)
            3) view a list of past events you've attended (see Past Events)
            4)
