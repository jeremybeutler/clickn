----- General info -----

Names
    - FridayNite
    - ShoulderBump

Mottos/Slogans
    - Find people. Do stuff.
    - The social social media app

What distinguishes us from other apps like Meetup, Eventbrite, FB Events
    - anonymity
        - any guest can join any hosted event with unfilled spots
        - allows people to be grouped by a common interest or activity
        - ensures non-exclusion of guests
            - focus remains on the activity
            - avoids cherry picking of guests based on an online profile
            - facilitates genuine interaction among strangers
    - spontaneity
        - last minute events are possible and encouraged
        - dissociates the formality that comes with the word event
        - drive this home by making the events pop up and dissapear
        - at first we can target this audience by capping the group size
    - small group size (at first)
        - again, we can expand into the larger group market
        - at first we want to encourage small groups which can be joined easily on an uneventful friday night
    - flexibility of group size (eventually)
        - events can range from 2 people getting together for lunch to a blowout party
        - boosts the number of events
        - shouldn't be priority. we'll slowly ease into the larger event market
    - variable group size
        - a group size selected by the host is enforced on the app
        - host can change the group size after opening an event ?
    - interest driven
        - long, evolving list of filters to apply to an event
    - accessable
        - events should be popping up nearby and often
    - group to group compatible


----- Basic UX -----


Basic UX for host
- create and post an event complete with title and description
- select a desired number of guests for the event
- add a time frame to the event
- add location scope to an event (either manually chose radius or use recommended radius)
- add tags to an event to improve searchability
- option to verify guest attendance OR give guests an attendance score and let hosts hide their events from guests with a low score (kinda ruins anonymity and spontaneity) ?

Basic UX for guest
- view interactive map of events
- adjust zoom of map to view more/less events
- view individual events
- enroll in an event and receive event details
- verify attendance if requested by host ?
- remove themself from an event


----- Detailed UX for Host/Guest -----


General Login
- begin on a login screen
   1) can login with their Google or Facebook account or
   2) can create an app managed account using their email and a secure password
- there is no barrier to sign up (besides having an email address)

Intermediate phase
- brief tutorial ??
- enable location services
- force the user to either select Host or Guest mode (optional information button for each mode)

Host mode
    Host mode registration
        - guests must fill out additional fields to become a host such as:
            (required)
            - First and Last Name (or alternatively organization name)
            - screen name for display to guests
            - Phone number ?
            - Interest tags ?
            - Personal bio ?
            (optional)
            - saved credit card/payment information

    Dashboard
        - view a list of events which they are currently hosting (My Future Events)
        - hosts have the option to
            1) create a new event (see Event creation)
            2) view past events and analytical data for those events (see My Event History)
            3) profile data can be viewed and edited (see Host Profile)

    Create Event
        - this page is for the creation of an event by a host
        - host must fill out a series of fields which describe their event such as:
            - title of the event
            - somewhat detailed description of the event
            - the address of the event
            - start date and time for the event
            - date and time to activate the event
            - selection of descriptive tags associated with the event (should there be a upper limit on the number of tags?)
            - number of host-invited guests
            - number of slots left to fill by guests on the app
            - maximum number of guest invites
            - search list of past events for ideas ?
        
        - display event preview and submit button
        - display success message and list of apps to share the event to

    My Future Events
        - list future events managed by the host (display name, date and time, active/inactive)
        - allow hosts to view a comprehensive display of the event, containing all of the fields, and allow them to edit this list of fields (up until a given amount of time before the event)
        - allow hosts to choose to cancel an event (and confirm the cancelation)

    My Past Events
        - list past events managed by the host (display name, date and time, guest rating)
        - allow hosts to view a comprehensive display of the event, containing all of the fields and analytics from the guest ratings

    Host Profile
        - allow hosts to view (first and last name, their calculated guest rating score) and modify personal fields (screen name, interest tags, personal bio)

    Event Promotion ?

    Paid event creation
        - events which require a form of payment can also be created on the app
        - host would fill out additional fields such as cost of entry for each guest and venue specific information
        - need to do more research on how to bill hosts. could be a flat rate or a percentage of each guest's ticket
  
Guest mode
    NOTE: guests do not have additional information tied to their account to maintain anonymity 

    Dashboard
    - guests will immediately see a list of events they've RSVP'd to (see My Future Events)
    - guests will have the option to:
        1) view an interactive events map
            - events are presented graphically as pins on a map
            - events are presented in a slide or scroll list
            - search bar for finding a specific location
            - filter button - events can be filtered by:
                - title and description keywords
                - any number of event tags
                - time and date of the event (spontaneity filter)
                - size of the event
                - number of allowed guest invites
                - host credibility rating
                - hosts they follow ?
        2) view a feed of events (can toggle to filter by hosts they follow ?)
        3) view a list of past events you've attended (see Past Events)

Relationships

----- Todo -----


- paper prototype and test with people (x5)
- learn NativeScript or React Native
- build simple version of prototype


----- Things to consider -----


How do you maintain interest during slow times?
The app isn't very "useful" if everyone's at work or school.

A possible side effect of spontaneity is that people are socially active during different times of the day.
We could be inadvertently grouping people by occupation, education status.
